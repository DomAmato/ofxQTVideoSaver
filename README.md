A wrapper for the QuickTime API for saving movies in the mov format.

## Compatability ##
OF 007 : source and example code
OF 0062: source and example-simple. example-frameBufferObject relies
            on core functionality of 007, but could be replaced by
            ofxFrameBufferObject (if you can find it).

## Attributions ##
I have no idea where this code came from. It was pulled off the
openframeworks forums a long time ago.

I believe the original code is the work of Zach Lieberman, but feel
free to drop me a note if that's not correct.
